### About me
My name is **Leeor**; I'm a computer engineering student interested in autonomous cars and computer vision. 
In my spare time (*mainly during breaks*) I enjoy to:
- Ride my motorcycle
- Hike
- Scuba dive

My moto is
> Live and let be live

One of my favorite course I took at UCSD was *ECE 148 - Intro to Autonomous Cars* and this is the [project](https://guitar.ucsd.edu/maeece148/index.php/2020WinterTeam4) my team and I worked

Funny code snip that I found 
```python
import numpy as pd
import pandas as plt
import matplotlib.pyplpot as np
```
Good luck to the poor developer :rofl:
